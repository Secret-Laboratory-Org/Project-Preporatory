# Secret Laboratory Org: Team Agreement 

## Team Members

Rocio C Martinez (Time Specialist), Mr. Knight, Kyle; Alex Chao, and Jon

## Cooperation Plan

1. What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
    - Rocio: Outlining & Plan
    - Kyle: Stamina, Persistence, CSS coloring and styles, Cares TOO MUCH
    - Alex: Completing goals by finding any and all means necessary to suceed. #futureboss
    - Jon: Mysterious, Sarcastic, Optimistic, Overall seems weird. But has the answers... and read incessently. Has CS Degree, and wrist braces. JavaScript and Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
    - We have a taskmaster, a design guru, a steadfast completionist, and comedic relief that will fill the gaps like gorilla glue for broken pottery. Team pairings to help keep everyone from being alone and lost on the island of disillusion and confusion.
3. In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - Teamwork, organization, clear communication of tasking and completion!
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - Rocio is going to be the Overall Project Supervisor or OPS #BOSS to make sure none of us procrastinators get stuck in a heated ranked Fortnite binge. We are planning to meet up twice daily (first 30, last 30) to have a morning briefing and will log minutes and update work-flow/task list.

## Communication Plan

A major part of our plan is to meet at a minimum 2x per day (first 30/last 30). We will have an active task list that builds out the TODO's on any given file that is being developed so we can stage pulls/pushes/merges/tests/mistakes/regrets/rewrites/fixes.

## Work Plan

Due Date is Friday May 26th 2023, meaning that is our presentation. But ***OBVIOUSLY*** we need everything **READY TO GOOOOOO** the day prior.. preferably in the afternoon.

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
    - All Assets used in the project
    - Planning documentation, to keep things stored and publically available

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
    - We're all members/contributors
    - We will all have discrete branches as users, but also perhaps for specific tasks

- What is your Git flow?
    - Protected Main, Separate Default Branch -> from there we branch off to do work. And here we merge prior to final merge to main. Main is our last concern.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    - How many people must review a PR: 2
    - Who merges PRs: The *Two* Alex = #1 , Jon = #Two
    - How often will you merge: After feature completion. 
    - How will you communicate that itâ€™s time to merge: Slack
